# better commit message on changed tessera
@status new
@type todo
// @tags

If you change an tessera, you get a pretty commit message
in your log showing you which tessera was changed.

However, it would be nice to extract the status info from the file
and add it to the commit message like:

"tessera updated: XZ, status: new"
